# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using NLP and Financial Sentiment

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and financial sentiment to predict Microsoft (MSFT) stock prices. It combines human-labeled sentiment data and FinBERT — a finance-specific transformer model — with historical stock price data to train a machine learning model.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
-  **FinBERT**: Transformer-based model for financial sentiment analysis
- 　**Takala Financial PhraseBank**: Human-labeled financial sentence dataset
-  **yfinance**: For downloading historical MSFT stock data
-  **Python**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **matplotlib**, **transformers**

---

## 🔍 What This Project Does
- Applies FinBERT to thousands of financial sentences to extract sentiment
- Simulates news dates to align sentiment with real stock prices
- Merges:
  - Previous day's stock price
  - Takala sentiment score (label-based)
  - FinBERT sentiment score (NLP)
- Trains a **Linear Regression model** to predict closing prices
- Evaluates model performance using RMSE, MAE, and R²

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| MAE    | ~1.78 |
| RMSE   | ~2.12 |
| R²     | **0.9198** ✅ |

> The model explains ~92% of the variation in MSFT stock prices using sentiment + historical price.
